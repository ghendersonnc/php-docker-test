# nginx, PHP, MySQL with Docker
Tested setting up those 3 services with docker, `src/public` is the webroot

MySQL will will be exposed on 3306 on your host. Can be changed if that port is already in used.

Could be used as a quick setup as well I suppose, you can change which PHP extensions are installed in `php/Dockerfile`.
